a serene pond scene with a lush green tree standing tall on a small island surrounded by water. The pond is bordered by a wooden bridge connecting two parts of the island. The water is teeming with various fish and there are lily pads floating on the surface. The surrounding area is filled with grass and small plants and the ground appears to be made of earthy tiles.
